KiDak- An Android virtual keyboard service with non-word error checking
Introduced the "NgWERTY" layout for typing in Khasi, with all 23 letters of the Khasi Alphabet, particularly the digraph 'Ng', and diaeresis 'Ï' and 'Ñ'. 
Also implemented a spell-checking module, focusing on "non-word errors"; using a khasi dictionary with over 6000 words, the Damerau-Levenshtein algorithm, and a module that selects 3 candidate words as possible corrections from an exhaustive list of candidates.Introduced the "NgWERTY" layout for typing in Khasi, with all 23 letters of the Khasi Alphabet, particularly the digraph 'Ng', and diaeresis 'Ï' and 'Ñ'.
